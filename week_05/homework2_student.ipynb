    "Before you can start having fun with a CTC ASR model, you first need to make sure that you can correctly \"decode\" or generate text from a working model. This can be done in two ways - using a Greedy Decoder, which is simple and fast, or using a Prefix Beam Search decoder, which is slower, but takes advantages of the fact that multiple plath though a CTC trellis can map to the sample sentence. In the following exercise you will implement both decoders."
